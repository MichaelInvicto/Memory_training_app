# Memory_training_app
This is a basic python GUI based memory training app

This project is still under development and you're free to add or edit my code...but as with all open source, feedback to the developer(s) is very essential
upon correction or addition to the project.

Unfortunately, because of lots of work, I'm only able to work on the project part time, but I'll do well to finish it up.

Memory development is a very important topic in our society yet it is very overlooked.
